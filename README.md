## Summary

You might assume that considering issues of AI ethics is the responsibility of only AI researchers, people who build and train AI models, and programmers who develop AI applications. But ethics has always been a core aspect of Content Design. 

As Content Designers, we focus on: story telling, explaining, clarifying, and teaching. We write product documentation and error messages, we create samples and tutorials, and we craft the words you see in graphical user interfaces. To be effective, we must perform user research to understand mental models people use to navigate technology like AI. 

We consider issues of ethics, justice, and fairness whenever we simplify terms of use, clarify the components of complex systems, explain the output of AI models, choose inclusive and transparent language, and highlight examples and tutorials that demonstrate ethical uses of AI. 

This exhibit demonstrates how Content Design builds trust and drives ethical outcomes.
